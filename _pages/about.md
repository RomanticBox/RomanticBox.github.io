## 👋 Hi, I'm Sunghyun Lee

I'm a machine learning researcher with a deep interest in **multimodal AI**, **AI for media**, and **AI for linguistics**.  
Currently, my research focuses on the intersection of **sound symbolism** and AI, aiming to understand how models capture and generate human-like phonosemantic patterns across languages.

Currently updating my website!

Beyond that, I explore the **creativity of AI** — how machines can generate novel ideas, expressions, or artifacts that go beyond human expectations, and how we might evaluate such output meaningfully.
